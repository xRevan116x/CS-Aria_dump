# aria

JSON dump used by CS:Aria in order to fetch data used in user login
and HWID lock (don't want/care for a dedicated login server).

CS:Aria is an external Python legit cheat for CS:GO in early alpha stages.
Initially made for the heck of it to try something new and uncommon in the
cheat-making community since most cheats are C++ based.

I guess I got bored of my assignments and wanted to test my Python skills.

Thanks to:
Fabien Reboia - for the pymem module, giving CS:Aria the low-level powers
                to compete against C++ cheats.
